  <che> but one file gets installed into the "wrong" location
  <che> actually it is the minitris.exe
  <che>  /usr/data/minitris.exe
  <che> is obviously "wrong" :D
  <che> should be using something like @DATADIR@/ring3k/ maybe?
  <che> or rather the libdir/ring3k
  <che> because it is an executeable.
